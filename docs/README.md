# Documentation

Living documentation?

... OK, examples?

## Examples

* [`assign-tickets-as-child.js`](assign-tickets-as-child.js) - // Assign a bunch of WRs to a parent WR. The link types in WRMS have never seemed meaningful to me, so I generally use the default, "I" (for "implemented in").
* [`show-hours-incl-children.js`](show-hours-incl-children.js) - Given that some tickets are child tickets (via "I") of a parent WR, find them and print their hours. WRMS should do this in the UI ...
